# Low-light enhancement

Low-light enhancement is the task of making an image captured under low-light conditions brighter or clearer.


## Datasets

The Low-light enhancement models featured in this Model Zoo are trained on the following datasets.

### LOL

LOL (LOw-Light dataset)[1] is a Low-light enhancement dataset.

It is comprised of 500 low-light and normal-light image pairs and divided into 485 training pairs and 15 testing pairs. All of the images are taken have the same resolution (400x600). The photos represent every-day life scenes and are taken indoors.


## Metrics

### PSNR

Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is a metric used to compare a reference image and its enhanced version. The higher the PSNR, the better the quality of the reconstruction of the reference image (ground truth).
