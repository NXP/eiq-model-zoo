# Keyword spotting - DS CNN

Keyword spotting model is a speech recognition network, trained to recognize set of words (see [Labels](#labels)). It is
a part of the [MLCommons tiny benchmark repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/tree/master) [2]. Model
architecture is depth-wise separable convolutional neural network, inspired by paper [3].

The model was trained on the Speech Commands dataset [1]. It is an audio dataset of spoken words, for training models
that detect when a single word is spoken. Itâ€™s released under

## Version and changelog

Initial release of quantized int8 model.

## Tested configurations

The quantized int8 models have been tested on i.MX 8M Plus and i.MX 93 using benchmark-model (
see [i.MX Machine Learning User Guide](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/IMX-MACHINE-LEARNING-UG.pdf)).

## Training and evaluation

The model has been trained and evaluated on the Speech commands dataset. It demonstrated 91.6% accuracy, according to
the paper [2].

## Conversion/Quantization

The model is downloaded in an archive which contains the quantized model float and int TensorFlow model.
See [the source of the model](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/blob/master/benchmark/training/keyword_spotting/quantize.py)
for information on the quantization procedure that was used.

## Use case and limitations

This model can be used for speech command recognition applications. It was trained on the limited vocabulary (
see [Labels](#labels)), so its use case is also limited.

## Performance

Here are performance figures evaluated on i.MX 8MP using BSP LF6.1.1_1.0.0 and i.MX93 using BSP LF6.1.36_2.1.0 and on
MCX N947 using MCUXpresso SDK, with
SDK version 2.13.0 MCXN10 PRC, Toolchain MCUXpresso IDE 11.7.1 and LibC NewlibNano (nohost):

## Download and run

To create the TFLite model fully quantized in int8 with int8 input and int8 output, run `bash recipe.sh`.

The TFLite model file for i.MX 8M Plus, i.MX 93 and MCX N947 is `.tflite`.  

**Note:** BSP >= LF6.1.36_2.1.0 supports Ethos-U Delegate on the i.MX93, which implements vela compilation online. If using an older BSP version, please compile the quantized TFLite model with Vela compiler before being used. Download Vela from [nxp-imx GitHub](https://github.com/nxp-imx/ethos-u-vela) from a branch, that corresponds with BSP version used.

An example of how to use the model is in `example.py`.

### How to run model

```bash
python example.py --feature_typ mfcc --tfl_file_name kws_ref_model.tflite --file 'example_input.wav'
```
